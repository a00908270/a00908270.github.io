# Container Based Execution Stack for Neural Networks (ConbexNN)
This a project features web services to train and evaluate neural networks using the Kubernetes container orchestration and a Java based microservice architecture. 

## Demo VM
![Screenshot VM](img/vm_small.jpg)See the project in Action by running a virtual machine. It comes preconfigured with Kubernetes running all necessary ConbexNN services and a neural network training set for testing.

You can try out the RESTful API and GUI.

## Specs

* Format: OVA 
* Size: 4.3 GB
* System Lubuntu 18.04.1 64bit
* Recommended RAM: 3GB
* Required disk space: 15 GB

Tested with VirtualBox 5.2.18 r124319 on macOS 10.13.6

* Password: `conbexnn`

## Features 
### Startup

![Startup script](img/autostart.png)

After Login the VM starts `autostart.sh` initalizing ConbexNN. The Iris testset and a ViNNSL neural network are automatically imported.

### Browser

Firefox is preinstalled and opens predefined Tabs

* Kubernetes Dashboard
* VINNSL-NN-UI (user interface showing imported neural networks)
* Swagger API (documentation of the ConbexNN RESTful interface)
* Status Tab (shows status of imported neural networks)
